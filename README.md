## What's this? ðŸŽƒ

A quick PoC to the idea of having a chain of responsability pattern on Deno with statistics reporting in every step.

## Why? ðŸ¤”

This could be usefull in projects with multiple steps that builds a response for a specific request of an user, so we can track the performance and status in every step in order to fix bugs and improve performance.

## But the code looks weird... ðŸ˜•

It's ok, this was made in a couple of minutes just to poke around the idea, I'll keep playing with this, improving the syntax and adding features.

## Sample execution output

```json

{
  data: { value: "7this should not work because of different types" },
  initialValue: { value: 0 },
  execData: [
    {
      timeElapsedMS: 0.007779999999998566,
      functionName: "AddOne",
      valueAtStep: { value: 1 }
    },
    {
      timeElapsedMS: 0.0011399999999994748,
      functionName: "AddOne",
      valueAtStep: { value: 2 }
    },
    {
      timeElapsedMS: 0.0008999999999996788,
      functionName: "AddOne",
      valueAtStep: { value: 3 }
    },
    {
      timeElapsedMS: 0.0007900000000002905,
      functionName: "AddOne",
      valueAtStep: { value: 4 }
    },
    {
      timeElapsedMS: 0.007181000000000992,
      functionName: "AddOne",
      valueAtStep: { value: 5 }
    },
    {
      timeElapsedMS: 0.005129999999999413,
      functionName: "AddTwo",
      valueAtStep: { value: 7 }
    },
    {
      timeElapsedMS: 0.022370999999999697,
      functionName: "ConcatenateString",
      valueAtStep: { value: "7this should not work because of different types" }
    }
  ]
}
